# Core Types

## number

No `int`, `floats`, `doubles` etc. They are all numbers
i.e. 1, 3, 1324657324, 1.23423 are all `number`

## string

Text format

## boolean

true/false. There are no truthy/falsy values.

## object

collections of key-value pairs. TypeScript provides more specific types of objects.

## Array

lists of data alues. Can be flexible strict regarding items types

## Tuple

A short form array of known length and known type.

## Enum

Not in vanilla js. Assign human readble labels to global values

## Any

Allows flexible assignment. Enables code but kind of defeats the object of TS
